We aim to provide a platform where the smartest thinkers, greatest visionaries, and most fascinating teachers will be inspired and will have the opportunity to inspire others. We hope that at our conference the diverse group of students, faculty, and alumni present will be able to learn from one another, both as speakers and attendees, and will leave the conference driven to creatively improve our collective future.</p>
